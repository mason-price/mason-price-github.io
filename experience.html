        <h2>Research</h2>
          My undergraduate research started in the Sciolla lab, where I learned how to perform data analysis associated with particle physics 
          using the ROOT data analysis framework.

        Since then, I joined the Rogers Lab where I have the incredible opportunity to study self-assembly of 
          nanostructures using DNA origami subunits. Here, I use Matlab to design new structures for self-assembly, and a combination of Python and Bash 
          to run simulations and data analysis. In addition, I have mastered experimental techniques such as gel electrophoresis and Transmission Electron 
          Microscopy (TEM). I presented this research at a variety of conferences, including MIT Polymer Day (2023), Brandeis Scifest (2023), Brandeis 
          Undergraduate Research and Creative Collaborations (2024), and the 100th Northeastern Complex Fluids Workshop (2024).

            <h2>Leadership</h2>
        In addition to research, I received a Math Mentor of the Year Award (2024) for my role as a math mentor for lowerclassmen pursuing a degree 
    in mathematics at Brandeis University. I have also TAâ€™d for Physics Laboratory 1 & 2. As a TA, I led a lab of 20 people, where I presented material 
    that I prepared every week, and helped students learn about physics, statistics and programming. I have also held the roles of Vice-President and Secretary 
    in the robotics club at Brandeis University.

            I was also lucky enough to be a part of the following Directed Reading Programs (DRP):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Introduction to Mapping Class Groups (2023)
