    <p>
      My undergraduate research started in the Sciolla lab, where I learned how to perform data analysis associated with particle physics 
      using the ROOT data analysis framework. Since then, I joined the Rogers Lab where I have the incredible opportunity to study self-assembly of 
      nanostructures using DNA origami subunits. Here, I use Matlab to design new structures for self-assembly, and a combination of Python and Bash 
      to run simulations and data analysis. In addition, I have mastered experimental techniques such as gel electrophoresis and Transmission Electron 
      Microscopy (TEM). I presented this research at a variety of conferences, including MIT Polymer Day (2023), Brandeis Scifest (2023), Brandeis 
      Undergraduate Research and Creative Collaborations (2024), and the 100th Northeastern Complex Fluids Workshop (2024).
